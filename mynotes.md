Looking at their current position (Year 6), they've actually already hit most Series B benchmarks. With $42.1M ARR and positive EBITDA, they're potentially positioned for a Series C round, which typically comes when companies reach $20-30M+ in ARR.
The ideal timing would have been around Year 3-4 when they had:

$13.7M ARR (Year 3)
119+ customers
Improving EBITDA trajectory
LTV/CAC ratio still very strong at 19.2x
