# AI SaaS Financial Modeling Suite

A comprehensive financial modeling toolkit for AI SaaS companies, providing detailed growth projections, cost analysis, and financial forecasts.

## Overview

This modeling suite helps AI SaaS companies forecast their financial performance over a 6-year horizon. It includes sophisticated models for customer acquisition, revenue growth, cost structure, and comprehensive financial analysis, with a special focus on the unique aspects of AI-driven businesses such as high R&D costs, cloud compute expenses, and enterprise sales dynamics.

## Models Included

### Growth Model (`models/growth_model.py`)

The SaaS Growth Model projects customer acquisition, retention, and revenue growth with segment-specific calculations:

- **S-curve acquisition modeling** for realistic customer growth patterns
- **Segment-based analysis** (Enterprise, Mid-Market, SMB)
- **Seasonality effects** on monthly acquisition
- **Churn modeling** based on customer cohorts
- **ARR projections** by segment and timeframe

### Cost Model (`models/cost_model.py`)

The AI SaaS Cost Model creates detailed expense projections:

- **Department-specific headcount planning** (Engineering, Sales, Marketing, etc.)
- **AI-specific cost categories** (cloud compute, research tools, model training)
- **Compensation modeling** (base salary, benefits, equity, etc.)
- **COGS structure** for SaaS delivery
- **Marketing and Sales expenses** with efficiency scaling
- **R&D investments** critical for AI companies

### Financial Model (`models/financial_model.py`)

The Integrated Financial Model combines growth and cost projections to create complete financial analysis:

- **Comprehensive P&L statements**
- **Cash flow projections** and capital requirements
- **Break-even analysis**
- **Unit economics** (CAC, LTV, CAC Payback Period)
- **Investor metrics** (Rule of 40, growth-adjusted metrics)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd 2025-financial-model

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
# Run the complete model with default parameters
python app.py

# Import models individually for custom analysis
from models.growth_model import SaaSGrowthModel
from models.cost_model import AISaaSCostModel
from models.financial_model import SaaSFinancialModel

# Create and run models with custom configurations
growth_model = SaaSGrowthModel(your_growth_config)
cost_model = AISaaSCostModel(your_cost_config)
financial_model = SaaSFinancialModel(growth_model, cost_model, initial_investment=25000000)

# Run the model
financial_model.run_model()
```

## Expected Outputs

The model generates both CSV data files and visualization charts:

### Key Reports

1. **Growth Metrics**

   - Customer acquisition and churn rates
   - ARR growth by segment
   - Customer segment distribution

2. **Cost Structure**

   - Headcount growth by department
   - Expense breakdown by category
   - AI-specific R&D and infrastructure costs

3. **Unit Economics**

   - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
   - Lifetime Value (LTV)
   - LTV/CAC ratio and payback periods

4. **Financial Performance**
   - Revenue, EBITDA, and margin projections
   - Break-even analysis
   - Cash flow and runway analysis

## Customization

The models are highly configurable through parameter dictionaries:

```python
# Example growth model configuration
growth_config = {
    'start_date': '2025-01-01',
    'projection_months': 72,  # 6 years
    'segments': ['Enterprise', 'Mid-Market', 'SMB'],
    'initial_arr': {'Enterprise': 150000, 'Mid-Market': 48000, 'SMB': 12000},
    # Additional parameters...
}

# Example cost model configuration
cost_config = {
    'headcount': {
        'engineering': {'starting_count': 5, 'growth_type': 'step', ...},
        # Additional departments...
    },
    'cogs': {'cloud_hosting': 0.18, 'customer_support': 0.08, ...},
    # Additional parameters...
}
```
