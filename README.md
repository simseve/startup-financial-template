# AI Governance SaaS Startup Financial Model

## Overview

This interactive financial model is designed for AI Governance SaaS startups. It provides a 6-year projection of key financial metrics with customizable parameters for various business aspects. The model is built using Streamlit and focuses on segment-based revenue modeling, realistic cost structures, and standard SaaS metrics.

## Key Features

- **Segmented Customer Base**: Model different customer segments (Enterprise, SME, Startup) with distinct pricing, growth rates, and churn profiles
- **Professional Services Revenue**: Include implementation and consulting revenue streams alongside core SaaS ARR
- **Department-Based Expense Modeling**: Track expenses by functional area (Development, Sales & Marketing, Operations, SG&A)
- **Headcount Planning**: Detailed headcount growth projections by department
- **Fixed Marketing Budget**: Realistic marketing budget allocation framework
- **Key SaaS Metrics**: Calculates critical metrics like LTV:CAC ratio, profitability timing, cash runway, etc.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time updates to financial projections as parameters change
- **Data Export**: Export all data to CSV for further analysis

## Model Structure

### Revenue Streams

The model incorporates three primary revenue streams:

1. **SaaS Subscription Revenue (ARR)**: Segmented by customer type

   - Enterprise clients: Higher price point, slower growth, lower churn
   - SME clients: Medium price point, moderate growth and churn
   - Startup clients: Lower price point, higher growth, higher churn

2. **Professional Services**: Implementation, training, and consulting services
   - Calculated as a percentage of ARR
   - Configurable margin profile

### Cost Structure

Expenses are categorized into:

1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**

   - Development team salaries and benefits
   - Development tools and infrastructure
   - Professional services delivery costs

2. **Sales & Marketing**

   - Fixed budget allocation rather than percentage-based
   - Sales team costs with benefits
   - Marketing program expenses

3. **SG&A (Sales, General & Administrative)**
   - Operations and G&A headcount expenses
   - Office and administrative costs
   - Cloud infrastructure costs
   - General overhead expenses

### Modeling Approach

The model follows these general principles:

1. **Bottom-Up Revenue Modeling**: Starting with initial customers by segment, ARR per customer, and growth/churn rates
2. **Activity-Based Costing**: Expenses tied to specific activities and scaling factors
3. **Progressive Efficiency Gains**: Increasing efficiency in later years
4. **Headcount-Driven Scaling**: Many costs directly tied to headcount growth
5. **Annual Contract Assumption**: No churn in year 1 due to annual contracts

## Using the Model

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the directory
cd 2025-financial-model

   - PS margin
   - PS growth rate

4. **COGS Assumptions**

   - COGS percentages by year

5. **Headcount Assumptions**

   - Initial headcount by department
   - Growth rates by department and year

6. **Salary & Benefits**

   - Average salaries by department
   - Benefits multiplier
   - Annual salary increases

7. **Marketing & Other Expenses**

   - Annual marketing budgets
   - Infrastructure and office costs
   - SG&A expenses

8. **Efficiency Gains**

   - Profitability timing
   - Cash runway analysis
   - LTV:CAC ratio

2. **Annual Summary**

   - Detailed financial metrics by year
   - Revenue and expense breakdown
   - Profit margins

3. **Department Breakdown**

   - Expense analysis by department
   - Headcount growth visualization
   - Customer segment analysis

4. **Export Data**
   - Download options for all model data
   - Parameter export for documentation

## SaaS Startup Modeling Strategy

### Early-Stage SaaS Business Model Framework

The model incorporates key SaaS business model principles:

1. **Land and Expand Strategy**

   - Start with initial customer base
   - Grow through both new customer acquisition and expansion within existing customers (ARR growth)

2. **Segmented Customer Approach**

   - Different value propositions and pricing for different customer segments
   - Segment-specific growth and retention strategies

3. **Upfront Investment for Future Growth**

   - Significant early investment in product development and marketing
   - Path to profitability through scaling efficiency

4. **Customer Retention Focus**
   - Modeling realistic churn profiles by segment
   - Emphasizing the importance of retention for SaaS economics

### Key Financial Assumptions for AI Governance SaaS

1. **Revenue Growth**

   - Initial customer acquisition is challenging but accelerates with market validation
   - Enterprise sales cycles are longer but contracts are larger
   - Product-market fit achieved by year 2-3 drives accelerated growth

2. **Cost Structure**

   - Development-heavy in early years to build product
   - Fixed marketing budgets reflecting reality of early-stage startups
   - Sales team expansion aligned with revenue growth
   - Infrastructure costs that scale with customer base

3. **Path to Profitability**
   - Typically EBITDA negative for first 2-3 years
   - Gross margin improves over time as product scales
   - Efficiency gains in years 3+ as operations mature
   - Operating leverage emerges as revenue outpaces cost growth

### Critical SaaS Metrics to Monitor

1. **Customer Economics**

   - Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
   - Lifetime Value (LTV)
   - LTV:CAC ratio (target >3x)
   - Months to recover CAC

2. **Growth Metrics**

   - Year-over-Year (YoY) revenue growth
   - Net new ARR per quarter/year
   - Net revenue retention (includes churn, expansion, contraction)

3. **Efficiency Metrics**
   - Gross margin
   - Sales efficiency (new ARR / sales & marketing spend)
   - Headcount efficiency (revenue per employee)
   - Rule of 40 (growth rate + profit margin)
